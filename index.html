<h1>Reflection Of Project</h1>
<p>When I decided to get this course I was confused about what I am going to follow. However, the curriculum is clear and easy to follow. Also, the sources direct us to learn more. Before attending the first lesson, I was as tight as a drum but a couple of minutes later I was relieved. The first lesson was important for me because the first impression makes a decision that how it will go all part of the course. Meeting with peers and with the tutor was exciting but I am really lucky to have a calm and supportive tutor. However, sometimes, I get confused in the live lessons. It would be much easier and clear for me if the tutor mentions what we are going to study today, and what we are going to continue next time. Thereby, I can follow the curriculum easily. 
</p>

<p>My first key takeaway is, googling is our best friend forever. After that, in HTML, we can create any kind of website easily. In CSS is much more fun to create whatever you want to see as a front-end developer. As far as I learned about JS seems as easy but in the background, it looks more complicated. Besides, you can do stuff in one line JS code more effectively comparing with HTML.
</p>

<p>My new path will not be easy but study continuously is the key to be successful. Therefore, I and my husband work together. My pillar of support is absolutely my husband. While he takes care of the kids, especially with a 16-month-old baby, I can study peacefully and I can focus. The first two weeks were orientation weeks. However, I tried to figure out the program and the system though. During the course keeping motivated is not easy, sometimes I feel so tired to study or the kids make me so busy. However, I do not let laziness get me out of my journey. I keep remembering that this is my aim. Therefore, I study every day for at least 15 mins. Because when I sat for study it always takes more than 15 mins. But the most important thing is I ask every single even stupid question and search what does it mean.
